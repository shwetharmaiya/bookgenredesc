Book Title with Authors , Genre , a Short Description of the book

I wanted a short description of a book list I prepared to see if I liked a book. Googling each book is cumbersome. I wanted a system which generates the book authors, genre and a short descrption to see if I liked a book. 
Thus was born bookgenredesc.

The files include: 

Books.xlsx - is the book list

The Google Books API key[Check below in Google Books API section ] should be added in the program 
Compile bookgenredesc.py  

P.S. There are 1000 free API queries allowed per day. Batch the request.
